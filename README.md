# Value-Complemented Monitoring Framework (VCMF)

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper "_Towards a Value-Complemented Framework forEnabling Human Monitoring in Cyber-Physical Systems_".


### Abstract.
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<em>[Context and Motivation]: </em> Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have become relevant in a wide variety of different domains, integrating
hardware and software, often operating in an emerging and uncertain environment where human actors actively or passively engage with the
CPS. To ensure correct and safe operation, and self-adaptation, monitors are used for collecting and analyzing diverse runtime information.<br>
<em>[Problem]:</em> However, monitoring humans at runtime, collecting potentially sensitive information about their actions and behavior, comes with
significant ramifications that can severely hamper the successful integration of human-machine collaboration. Requirements engineering (RE)
activities must integrate diverse human values, including Privacy, Security, and Self-Direction during system design, to avoid involuntary data
sharing or misuse..<br> 
<em>Principal Ideas]:</em> In this research preview, we focus on the importance of incorporating these aspects in the RE lifecycle
of eliciting and creating runtime monitors.<br>
<em>[Contribution]:</em> We derived an initial conceptual framework, building on the value taxonomy introduced by Schwartz and human value integrated Software Engineering by
Whittle, further leveraging the concept of value tactics. The goal is to tie functional and non-functional monitoring requirements to human values and establish traceability between values, requirements, and actors.
Based on this, we lay out a research roadmap guiding our ongoing work in this area.
